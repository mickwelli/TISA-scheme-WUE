# TISA-scheme-WUE

## About the package

There is a [`TISA-scheme-WUE` pkgdown
site](https://mickwelli.github.io/TISA-scheme-WUE/index.html) with vignettes.

This site presents data and code for analysing trends in crop water use efficiency (WUE) at irrigation schemes that participated in the Transforming Irrigation in Southern Africa (TISA) project.

To reproduce the analysis and plots, run the scheme specific R scripts, then run the WUE plots R script.

The map below shows the location and extent of each irrigation scheme analysed.
